//! A disposable database per test.
//!
//! Enabled by the `test-support` feature so it is never compiled into a service binary.

//! Each test gets its own database rather than its own transaction. A transaction would be faster,

//! that raises — behave differently inside one, and a suite that cannot observe a trigger firing
//! is not testing the schema it claims to test.
